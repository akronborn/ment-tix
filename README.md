The dilemma:

After speaking with other developers, professional and novices in different fields, and hobbyists of various of interests, all seem to deal with the same recurring problem: a lack of mentorship. New developers are often afraid of asking too many questions or coming across as unqualified to their collegues. Whether dealing with imposter syndrome or needing career advice (not being sure which path to take, where their skills might be lacking,etc), having a mentor can do wonders for one's professional development.

How Ment-tix addresses this problem:
This platform pairs unvested mentors with mentees who would benefit from the counsel of someone with valuable experience, knowledge, and skills, whos careers are not threatened by their mentees development.

Hobbyists, amateurs, and other interested parties can also benefit from a mentor. Perhaps someone is planning a multi-country trip and would like to consult with a well traveled mentor who has visited or lived in several countries. An experienced photographer may mentor a novice on the best equipment, how to get better shots, how to sell their photos, or how to determine pricing. A prospective mentor may know how to build up a Twitch, Tik Tok, or Youtube channel or how best to profit from a social media following. The possibilities are endless.

Ment-Tix is a secure, ecommerce platform where users can purchase one on one sessions to mentors or gain access to a mentoring event or experience (ex. a live Q&A).
